Path_maker Language Description  
Data Types: Path is the only data type. Path constants are relative directory path expressions  
written in the form:  
<dir1/dir2/dir3> where dir1, dir2 and dir3 are directory names  
• No file names are of any concern (just directories)  
• Directory names start with a letter (upper or lower case) and are made of any  
combination of letters, digits and underscore characters (only). (Punctuation  
characters are not allowed. Blank characters are not allowed either.) Directory names  
are not case sensitive so <AA> and <aa> are basically the same. (since that is the policy  
of most operating systems)  
• Operator “*” can be used instead of a directory name, and it indicates parent directory.  
It can be used multiple times before any other directory name.  
Example: <*/*/mydirectory> indicates that one should move up (to parent) twice  
and then choose mydirectory.  
• Operator * can only be used at the beginning of path expressions. <hi/*/there> is not  
allowed.  
• Operator / cannot be used at the beginning or the end of any path. So </hi/there> is  
not allowed. Neither is <hi/there/> allowed.  
• Blanks in a path expression are ignored (unless they exist in a directory name (which is  
not allowed)) so < * /* / mydirectory> is OK.  
Variables: There are no variables in the language.  
Basic Commands: The only two basic commands are “make” and “go”. Make has the form:  

make <myDirectoryPath>;  
It simply creates the directories in the myDirectoryPath. If the path already exists it does  
nothing (but gives a warning message). If the path partially exists, it completes the path.  
Example: make <*/project1/data> goes up once and then creates a directory called project1  
and then creates another one called “data” inside it.  
“make” does not change the current (working) directory. (This is what we do with go  
command)  
“go” simply changes the current directory  
Syntax: go <myPathExpression>;  
If the path does not exist, go does nothing. (Gives an error message but does not exit the  
execusion) It does not partially follow a path. Partial existence of any path is considered as  
inexistence.  
Control Structures: There is an “if” clause and a similar “ifnot” clause  
if <path_expression> command  
is the basic form of this clause where command can be a basic command or a block. “if” clause  
executes the command if from the current directory the path <path_expression> exists.  
“if” does not change the current directory.  
“ifnot” clause has the exact same structure  
ifnot <path_expression> command  
but operates if the path <path_expression> does not exist.  
Blocks: A command can be a basic command (“make” or “go”) but it can also be a block. A  
block is a list of lines of code enclosed in { } set brackets. Blocks may also be nested in one  
another.  
End of line character: Only “make” and “go” commands require an end of line character and  
it is ‘;’ (semi-colon)  
Keywords: Keywords are case sensitive and all are lowercase. They are:  
make, go, if, ifnot  
Symbols: < , > , { , } , / , *  
Code Example:  
if <*>  
{ go <*>; make <data/doctors>;  
 if <user/ahmet> go <path_expression>;  
}
